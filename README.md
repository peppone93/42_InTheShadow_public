# InTheShadow

The goal of the project: to develop a game close to Shadowmatic.  
The goal of the game: the player must use an object in the foreground to create a shadow that looks like a familiar shape in the background.  
The gameâ€™s website: http://www.shadowmatic.com/

__NOTE:__
The aim of this project is to implement a simple game from A to Z using a game engine.
The game design is not too complex, but it requires a little creativity.
A test mode will take the player on a path where all the puzzles are unlocked.
The game must be played with a mouse only.
To differentiate the rotation and the movement, you can combine the mouse click with a keyboard key.
The shadow validation management must be neither too demanding, nor too permissive.
Objects must move smoothly.

__Realized options:__
- Beauty: Textures, Decoration, 3D menu
- Creativity: More levels than required
- Immersion: Different soundtracks and effects
